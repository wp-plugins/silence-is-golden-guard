It prevents your blog directories from listing requests with redirect to home page, removes unused txt, screenshot files from plugins directories.

== Description ==

Silence is Golden Guard plugin prevents WordPress blog directories from listing if visitor types just directory name as the URL, e.g. 
http://yourdomain/wp-content/plugins/
Plugin can automatically check WordPress site state and fix it if needed once a day.
The checking are:
* .htaccess file. If it has not Options -Index line, plugins makes
backup copy and adds Options -Indexes line into .htaccess file in the WordPress
root directory.
* Plugin can check if empty index.php file exists in the every directory. If index.php file doesn't exist,
plugin creates one with comments line 'Silence is golden' as WordPress does.
This check and fix are useful as many plugin authors do not put index.php files into their plugin directories.
Redirect to the site root option from index.php call is available.
* Other functions:
* remove unused files (readme.txt, screenshot-*.*)  from plugins folders, which could expose plugin versions to attacker.
* remove WordPress version information from blog pages.

<strong>There is a very strong recommendation to make full backup of your blog before you activate SIG plugin.</strong> If you have development copy of your blog at the same webhost I recommend you to give a SIG plugin first try at the test environment as there are small amount of incidents when with redirection to site root option turned on automatically created empty index.php file caused endless redirect loop and prevents site loading.
It could be the case if you use child theme and theme_name-child folder has not its own index.php file and some other cases which are not isolated yet. 


== Installation ==

Installation procedure:
Attention! Starting from version 1.7 plugin works with WordPress 3.0 and higher only. For earlier WordPress versions use plugin version 1.6 from http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/silence-is-golden-guard.1.6.zip
1. Deactivate plugin if you have the previous version installed. (It is important requirement for switching to this version from a previous one.)
2. Extract "silence-is-golden-guard.x.x.x.zip" archive content to the "/wp-content/plugins/silence-is-golden-guard" directory.
3. Activate "Silence is Golden Guard" plugin via 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin menu. 
4. Go to the "Settings"-"SIG Guard" menu item and check/change your preferences to customize how this plugin will work for you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* I activated Silence is Golden plugin and click Scan button. Now I have not access to my site, neither front-end, nor admin back-end. FireFox writes "Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete." What is happend and how to fix it?
* This problem could be met if you use WP Super Cache plugin and turned on the redirection to site root option for SIG plugin. If you put index.php file with redirection to root directive into wp-super-cache/plugins/ folder you will get exactly that problem as it is described above.
To resolve this SIG plugins checks from v. 1.5 if WP Super Cache plugin is active, and in this case creates the empty index.php file in the wp-super-cache/plugins/ folder, that is SIG ignores redirection option for this folder.
Problem could be left if WP Super Cache is placed under another path, and WP Super Cache plugin root folder name differs from the default one "wp-super-cache".
To resolve endless redirection loop problem remove the 'header("Location: http://www...' line from wp-super-cache/plugins/index.php file. It will resolve your problem with the high level of probability.
If you can not resolve the problem yourself left a comment at <a href="http://www.shinephp.com/silence-is-golden-guard-wordpress-plugin/">SIG plugin page</a> and I will try to help you.
